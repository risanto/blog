description: Things I've learned from three weeks of job-hunting and reading
  several forums and blogs.

Just a month ago I was busy searching for a job after getting laid off from my previous company. In total during the span of three weeks, I applied to 73 job postings, which eventually resulted in 4 job offers.

###### I was scared that finding a job during pandemic was gonna be hard so I applied to as many job postings as I could. In hindsight, I should've made a more targeted and strategic approach in my job applications instead of focusing on quantity.

I want to write some of the things I learned from the whole job-hunting process and also from reading several forums and blogs. So, let’s start.

**Don’t get intimidated by job requirements**

Many people with 1 year or less work experience might get intimidated by job postings that say they require 3 years of experience, or if you’re a software engineer then seeing a long list of tech stacks might deter you from applying to a job posting, and if you’re a coding bootcamp graduate with a non-CS degree like me then you might get discouraged when you see a job posting requiring a CS degree.

But note that sometimes (or even a lot of times) the qualifications listed on the job postings are just the recruiter’s wishlist. Since job postings nowadays receive so many applicants, recruiters might choose to pad the qualifications to increase the barrier of entry in order to filter the number of applicants.

So, don’t be afraid to apply to a job posting if it seems interesting enough to you. The worse that could happen is getting ghosted or rejected, which is just a risk that comes with job-hunting.

In my experience, despite only having one year of experience (in teaching software development), I still get called to interview with companies that stated the jobs require 2–4 years of experience.

**Remember that interviews work both ways**

It’s not all about companies interviewing you but it’s also about you *interviewing the company*. If you’ve received an interview invitation, be sure that besides preparing the answers for their questions you also prepare some questions that’ll help your decision-making process. For me, I usually always ask questions related to work-life balance, company culture, tools and teammates that I’m gonna work with.

I once decided not to continue to the next step with a company because I found that the company culture wouldn’t fit me. Both role and cultural fit are important to me, so it definitely saves both my and my interviewers’ time if I get to know it beforehand on my initial interview.

**Be honest about what you know and don’t know**

I remember during one job interview I answered some technical questions by making things up whenever I wasn’t that sure about the answer. Huge mistake. Suffice to say, they didn’t contact me again after that.

Admitting that you don’t know something is totally acceptable and human, besides, employers won’t expect you to know everything, and if they do expect otherwise then it’s not the kind of company that you want to work in. Just imagine the pressure of working in a place where you’re expected to know everything.

Another thing is to set your interviewers’ expectations. The job posting might say that they require certain skills that you don’t have. Just be honest and say that you don’t know those things but are willing to learn in case that the job requires them.

During the technical interview of my current job, my mind went blank a lot. There were many questions that I didn’t know the answers to and I just admitted that I knew nothing about them. I thought I bombed the interview, but hey, I actually got offered the job. So, maybe, the things that I do know make up for the things that I don’t know.

**Say your expected salary but do some research first**

There are differing opinions regarding this matter, there are those who say that you should never say your expected salary because it’s gonna be a lose-lose situation: either you put a number too high which is out of your employer’s budget or a number too low in which that you’re gonna get severely underpaid.

These are some valid concerns but personally, I subscribe more to those who say that you should reveal your expected salary. Why? Because of the anchoring effect. Quoting from [Harvard’s Program On Negotiation blog](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/negotiation-skills-daily/the-drawbacks-of-goals/):

> “The anchoring effect is a cognitive bias that describes the common human tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered.”

So, by setting a number as an anchor you’re setting it as a base point for the recruiter to consider the amount of salary that they’d offer— which you can expect to be 10–20% less than your ask price. So, be sure to set your expected salary (or the lowest number if you’re giving a range) to be 10–30% more than the actual number that you’re willing to accept.

But what if you set a number too high or too low? Then that’s where research comes into play, [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/) and [Qerja](https://www.qerja.com/) are quite helpful in providing the salary data of many companies. Although I find the data for the Indonesian companies are quite limited. Or if you have previous work experience you can set your last salary as your baseline, so that you put your expected salary to be at least 10–20% above that.

**Be transparent about your current job-hunting progress to your recruiters**

Firstly, it makes your recruiters’ jobs easier if they have the information about the stage of job-hunting that you are at, whether you’ve received some offers or not, and what amount of compensation and benefits was offered, etc.

And if you’ve already received some job offers, revealing that to the recruiters might send a signal that your talent is in demand. The recruiters might be willing to expedite the interview processes and make the recruiting timeline works better for you, and if they give an offer they might also give a more competitive salary package using your other offer(s) as the benchmark.

Just be careful not to lie about receiving job offers or use it to make the recruiters compete with each other because it might come back to bite you if they decide that they’d better focus on other candidates who are easier to work with or are more likely to accept the job, so then you are left with no fallback plan once you lose the offer.

**Negotiate but don’t get greedy**

Let’s say now you’ve received an offer but it’s somewhat below your expected salary. Do note that negotiating is always an option and recruiters might usually give some wiggle room (except if their budget is really tight). The worst thing that could happen is them saying no to your counteroffer, but many might increase their initial offer and willing to meet in the middle with you.

So, what to say when they give you an offer below your expected salary? Firstly, always thank them for offering you the position, but then also say if you’re not happy with the amount since it’s still below your expected salary, and then ask them if they’re willing to negotiate. What if they say that the number is final? Then decide whether you should walk out from the negotiation or whether you’re willing to go with their offer.

Now, what if they give you an offer within your expected salary range? Well, you can still ask whether they’re still open to negotiation. At best, they might be able to increase their offer by 5–10%, but I personally don’t think it’s worth the hassle if I’m already happy with their initial number. At this point, it might just be greed talking, but hey, it’s never a bad thing to try to negotiate and maybe get a few percentage increases to your salary.

**Job referrals are still king**

Two of the job offers I got were from the companies that I got referred to by friends. I also got an interview for my first job out of college from my friend’s referral. So, it seems that the chance of scoring a job interview and offer is much higher if you’re referred to the company from their employees or former employees.

Besides my anecdotal experience, [Glassdoor Economic Research from 2015](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/interview-sources/#) also backs this up, stating the employee referral as the interview source that is the most likely to lead to a job offer — 2.6 to 6.6% of increase compared to online applications which decrease the probability by -11.4 to -15%.

Why is this so? My guess is that employers are more likely to trust the candidates that are referred to by their employees or former employees because by referring them then they are vouching for candidates with their reputations so it’s less likely that they’re just gonna refer some random people.

**Conclusion**

To sum it up, these are the points that I learned from my job-hunting experience:

1. Oftentimes, job requirements are just the company’s wishlist. Don’t be discouraged to apply as long as the job posting seems interesting to you.
2. Interviewing the company is just as important as the company interviewing you. Use it as a chance to know about the company and its work culture better.
3. You might need to sell yourselves during job interviews, but please be honest about what you know and don’t know.
4. Set a number for your expected salary to take advantage of the anchoring effect, just make sure that you’ve done your research and are realistic with your number.
5. Make your recruiters’ jobs easy by keeping them updated with your current job-hunting progress. It will work in your favour too.
6. Once you’ve received an offer try to negotiate and get it as close to your expected salary as possible, but don’t get greedy and firstly decide what’s “enough salary” for you.
7. Utilise your network and get referred to jobs because it yields the biggest chance for a job offer.

Do note that many of these tips come from my anecdotal experience and from reading other people’s anecdotal experiences. So take it with a grain of salt and please utilise the best strategy for your situation. Regardless, I hope it might help if you’re currently hunting for jobs.
